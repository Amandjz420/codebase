# Django Project: Codebase

## Overview

This project is a Django-based application designed for code processing and analysis. It integrates with OpenAI's language models to provide functionalities such as code summarization, file processing, and security analysis. The application is structured to handle project and file management through a RESTful API interface.

- **codebase/**: The main Django project directory containing settings and configurations.
  - **settings.py**: Central configuration for the Django project.
  - **urls.py**: Central URL configuration for routing requests.
  - **wsgi.py**: WSGI configuration for serving the application in production.
  - **asgi.py**: ASGI configuration for handling asynchronous web requests.

- **code_reader/**: The main application handling code processing.
  - **models.py**: Defines the `Project` and `File` models for managing project-related data.
  - **serializers.py**: Serializes and deserializes project and file data for API interactions.
  - **views.py**: Defines API views for handling project and file operations.
  - **urls.py**: URL routing specific to the `code_reader` application.
  - **admin.py**: Configures Django admin for managing `Project` and `File` models.
  - **apps.py**: Application configuration for `code_reader`.
  - **migrations/**: Database migration files, including `0001_initial.py` for initial schema setup.
  - **executor/**: Contains modules for executing code-related tasks.
    - **outputparser.py**: Models and validates task execution responses.
    - **tools.py**: Provides tools for executing tasks and modifying code files.
    - **utils.py**: Utility functions for task execution and session management.
    - **main.py**: Orchestrates workflows for code analysis.
    - **agent_functions.py**: Manages task execution using agent-based workflows.

- **README.md**: Project overview and documentation.

## Key Components

- **OpenAI Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's language models for natural language processing tasks, such as code summarization and analysis.
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for managing projects and files, supporting CRUD operations.
- **Admin Interface**: Custom actions and display options for managing projects and files via Django's admin panel.
- **Task Execution**: Automated execution of tasks using agents and workflows, integrating terminal and language model capabilities.

## Usage

To interact with the application, use the API endpoints defined in the `code_reader` app. You can perform CRUD operations on projects and files, authenticate users, and execute queries for code analysis.

## API Endpoints

- `/api/projects/`: Manage project resources.
- `/api/files/`: Manage file resources within projects.
- `/api/login/`: User authentication.
- `/api/document_detail_fetch/`: Fetch detailed file data.
- `/api/projects/<project_id>/query/`: Execute queries related to a specific project.
